_»You can teach a man to fish, but you can not teach a fish to man.«_

While that says absolutely nothing about me, this is also true for the following statement:

_»It's colder at night than behind the mountain.«_

Between my job as a professional human and wasting your time with nonsensical quotes, my hobbies include

- Playing the Tuba, either in the worlds greatest and most famous big brass bouncing and bollar band, or following people
- Wresting virtual snakes (aka coding in Python), both for silly side projects and to help maintaining the
  glorious [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org) library
- Amateurishly designing logos for everything that needs one and, of course, for everything that doesn't need one

When idling, I usually fall back to my mantra
